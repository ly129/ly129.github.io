<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in Biostatistics, under the guidance of <a href=https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/qi-long-phd>Dr. Qi Long</a>, in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania. <br> <br>

Previously I received my PhD in Biostatistics (supervised by <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/robert-william-platt>Dr. Robert Platt</a> and <a href=https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/>Dr. Archer Yi Yang</a>) and Master's degree in Epidemiology (supervised by <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/samy-suissa/>Dr. Samy Suissa</a> and <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/laurent-azoulay>Dr. Laurent Azoulay</a>), from McGill University, Montréal, Canada.<br><br>

My research experience and expertise encompass high-dimensional statistical learning, federated learning, missing data methods, integrative analysis for heterogeneous data, and pharmacoepidemiology. I am passionate about addressing concrete and meaningful clinical research questions using both classical and novel statistical and machine learning methods, leveraging data from electronic health records and clinical trials.<br><br>

I am particularly interested in clinical trials. I have rich experience in statistical analysis planning, analysis and reporting for trials. I am currently exploring the use of large language models and foundation models in clinical trial design, conduct and analysis.
